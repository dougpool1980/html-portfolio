<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Pontiac, Michigan in 1961. I was involved in wrestling for eight years, also participated in cross country,
   football, tennis teams. As a graduate of Hazel Park High School, we had famous athletes such as Steve Fraser who won 
   a gold medal in the 1980 Olymics. Also was attended by Bob Welch who pitched professional baseball for The Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>

<p>I joined the Army a year after High School where I was sent to Fort, Oklahoma for my basic training. I spent my first couple of years at Fort Ord, CA.,
   and from there I went Camp Stanley, Korea.</p>

<p>Shortly after getting out, I was married for 15 years to a woman named Elizabeth and we had our beautiful daughter Samantha, and a step-daughter Olivia.
   After time has passes and Samantha had grown up, I decided to relocate to Los Angeles and brings me to where I'm at today.
